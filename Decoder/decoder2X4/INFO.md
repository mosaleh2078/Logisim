In this project, I attempted to implement a 2x4 decoder at three different abstraction levels.
The first implementation is done using AND, NOT, and BUFFER gates. But this implementation is not suitable for CMOS abstraction, so I designed the second abstraction.
The second implementation has the same logic as the first one, but uses NAND, NOT, and BUFFER-INVERTER.
The third and last implementation uses CMOS transistors.
